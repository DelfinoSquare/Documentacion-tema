#DS3 lore

Dark Souls 3 takes place in a transitory place, revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark.
You play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five Lords of Cinder to their thrones to
 their thrones at Firelink Shrine in order to link the flame again. he protagonist is known as an Unkindled,
a kind of Undead, although it is never fully enunciated upon what differentiates an Unkindled from other Undead. 
There are implications that an Unkindled is the remains of an Undead warrior who failed to link the flame and, 
as a result, burned their bodies into ash.
